      Each benchmark is located in a tree of groups, and can be assigned a
      {{!name}qualified name} like [group1/group2/bench]. A query component is
      the full path to a benchmark or a group. As a special case, an empty
      [NAME] between slashes selects all groups at that level.

      For example:

      {ul
      {- ["a"] selects the top-level benchmark named [a], or all the benchmarks
      in the top-evel group [a].}
      {- ["a/b/x"] selects the benchmark (or group) named [x] in group [b] in

      {- [`Bad] - [e] is likely meaningless. It poorly describes the data.}
      {- [`Undef] - [e] is not defined over the data.}}

      [e] can fail to describe the data for reasons ranging from successfully
      filtering out the noise, to data being non-linear and [e] being completely
      meaningless. Rules of thumb:

      {ul
      {- More samples should improve validity.}
      {- If [b] stays stable over repreated runs, the measurement is noisy, but
      the estimate is good.}}

      [e] is most commonly undefined when the data is all-0, in which case [0]
      is still a good summary of it.

      [validity] is currently implemented by checking [RÂ²].
      [`Undef] is [RÂ² = 0],
      [`Bad] is [0 < RÂ² < 0.9],

  (** {{: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LeastSquaresFitting.html}
      Ordinary Least Squares} is the usual linear regression that minimizes
      average squared residuals (and maximizes [RÂ²]).

      OLS assumptions are somewhat violated by the benchmarking procedure: the
      errors have a heavy positive tail (instead of being normally distributed),
      and their variance grows with the number of iterations (instead of being
      independent of [X]). As a result, the estimates are overly affected by
      noise and tend to have less stability across runs, while the confidence
      intervals tend to be too narrow to predict this instability.

      On the upside, OLS is quick to compute, well known, and readily
      interpretable. *)

  val tse : estimator
  (** {{: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theil%E2%80%93Sen_estimator}
      Theilâ€“Sen Estimator} is an order-based linear regression.

      It provides a robust estimation in the sense that
      {ul
      {- the result is unaffected by even a relatively large proportion of
      outliers (about 30%); and}
      {- there is no assumption on the error distribution,}}
      making TSE resilient against the skewed benchmark noise, and giving it
      good stability across runs.

      Note that by design, TSE does not maximize [RÂ²]. For this reason, [RÂ²] is
      not an entirely accurate way of assessing goodness-of-fit for this method,
      and perfectly good estimates are sometimes flagged as having poor
      {{!validity}[validity]}. A particular failure case happens with results
      resembling a step-function, where TSE sometimes (correctly) assigns a
      vanishingly small [b], and a biased [a] that offsets the line. Such
      predictions have an error larger than the sample mean, resulting in a
      negative [RÂ²].

      Persistently low [RÂ²] should be investigated by plotting the results.

      TSE is the default estimator in Unmark.

(** {1:examples Examples}

  A single benchmark measuring [f: unit -> t] for some [t]:

{[
let bm = bench "eff" f
]}

  A group of benchmarks:

{[
let bm = group "things" [
  bench "this" f;
  bench "that" g;
]
]}

  Group nesting:

{[
let bm = group "stuff" [
  group "more" [ bench "x" x ];
  group "less" [ bench "y" y ];
]
]}

  A group acquiring a resource:

{[
let bm path = group_f "files" (fun fd ->
  [ bench "f1" (fun () -> f1 fd);
    bench "f2" (fun () -> f2 fd);
  ])
  ~init:Unix.(fun () -> openfile path [O_RDONLY] 0)
  ~fini:Unix.close
]}

  Using a group to delay construction of data:

{[
let bm = group_f "big data" (fun () ->
  let really_big_value = ... in
  [ bench "f" (fun () -> f really_big_value) ]
  ) ~init:ignore ~fini:ignore
]}

  Independent variable.

  Creates a group, containing 3 subgroups. Each subgroup instantiates [f1] and
  [f2] with a different argument. Leaf-level benchmarks are annotated with the
  argument, keyed by [en].

{[
let pp_int ppf = Format.fprintf ppf "%d"
let en = Attr.key pp_int ~name:"en"
